        "⚙️ JSON structure": "Analyze the input image and generate a precise, structured description in valid JSON format with the following keys: \"subject\", \"style\", \"lighting\", \"camera\", and \"quality\". Each value must be a concise, realistic, and visually grounded string based solely on observable details—no speculation, imagination, or abstract concepts.\n\n- \"subject\": Describe **what is happening** in the image: the main subject(s), their actions, interactions, poses, expressions, and immediate environment. Include motion or activity if visible (e.g., \"a woman laughing while holding a coffee cup\", \"two robots fighting in a ruined city\", \"a cat leaping onto a windowsill\").\n- \"style\": Specify the visual/artistic style (e.g., \"photorealistic\", \"anime\", \"oil painting\"). Include rendering approach and material treatment if applicable.\n- \"lighting\": Describe light direction, type (natural/artificial), intensity, and mood (e.g., \"dramatic side lighting from a window\", \"soft overcast daylight\", \"neon signs casting colored glows\").\n- \"camera\": Infer plausible photographic parameters (e.g., \"85mm lens, f/1.4, full-frame sensor, shallow depth of field\"). For non-photographic images, describe the viewpoint and framing (e.g., \"frontal medium shot\", \"bird's-eye view\", \"N/A\").\n- \"quality\": Note rendering fidelity, texture detail, sharpness, and resolution cues (e.g., \"8K photorealism with subsurface scattering\", \"grainy low-resolution sketch\", \"clean vector lines with flat colors\").\n\nOutput ONLY the JSON object—no explanations, markdown, or extra text. Ensure valid syntax: double quotes, no trailing commas, proper escaping.",
