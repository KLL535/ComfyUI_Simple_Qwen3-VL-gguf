        "🖼️ Tags": "Your task is to generate a clean list of comma-separated tags for a text-to-image AI, based *only* on the visual information in the image. Limit the output to a maximum of 50 unique tags. Strictly describe visual elements like subject, clothing, environment, colors, lighting, and composition. Do not include abstract concepts, interpretations, marketing terms, or technical jargon (e.g., no 'SEO', 'brand-aligned', 'viral potential'). The goal is a concise list of visual descriptors. Avoid repeating tags.",
        "🖼️ Simple Description": "Analyze the image and write a single concise sentence that describes the main subject and setting. Keep it grounded in visible details only.",
        "🖼️ Detailed Description": "Generate a detailed paragraph that combines the subject, actions, environment, lighting, and mood into 2-3 cohesive sentences. Focus on accurate visual details rather than speculation.",
        "🖼️ Ultra Detailed Description": "Produce an extremely rich description touching on appearance, clothing textures, background elements, light quality, shadows, and atmosphere. Aim for an immersive depiction rooted in what the image shows.",
        "🎬 Cinematic Description": "Describe the scene as if capturing a cinematic shot. Cover subject, pose, environment, lighting, mood, and artistic style (photorealistic, painterly, etc.) in one vivid paragraph emphasizing visual impact.",
        "🖼️ Detailed Analysis": "Describe this image in detail, breaking down the subject, attire, accessories, background, and composition into separate sections.",
        "📹 Video Summary": "Summarize the key events and narrative points in this video.",
        "📖 Short Story": "Write a short, imaginative story inspired by this image or video.",
        "🧩Prompt Refine & Expand": "Refine and enhance the following user prompt for creative text-to-image generation. Keep the meaning and keywords, make it more expressive and visually rich. Output **only the improved prompt text itself**, without any reasoning steps, thinking process, or additional commentary.",
        "🧩JSON structure": "Analyze the input image and generate a precise, structured description in valid JSON format with the following keys: \"subject\", \"style\", \"lighting\", \"camera\", and \"quality\". Each value must be a concise, realistic, and visually grounded string based solely on observable details—no speculation, imagination, or abstract concepts. \n- \"subject\": Describe the main subject, pose, framing, expression, and any notable visual context (e.g., \"same pose, framing and expression as reference image 1 (cartoon frame)\").  \n- \"style\": Specify the visual/artistic style (e.g., \"hyper-realistic photography\", \"anime illustration\", \"oil painting\"). Include surface and material realism if applicable.  \n- \"lighting\": Describe light direction, type, and mood (e.g., \"soft natural daylight, subtle shadows, cinematic contrast\").  \n- \"camera\": Infer plausible photographic parameters (e.g., \"full frame DSLR, 50mm lens, f/1.8, shallow depth of field, 4k resolution\"). If non-photographic, state \"N/A\" or describe equivalent viewpoint.  \n- \"quality\": Note rendering fidelity, texture detail, and resolution cues (e.g., \"photorealistic, high dynamic range, detailed fabric and textures\").  \nOutput ONLY the JSON object—no explanations, markdown, or extra text. Ensure valid syntax (no trailing commas, proper quotes).",
        "🎨 Style Identification": "Analyze the input image and describe **only its artistic or visual style** in a single, detailed sentence. Focus exclusively on stylistic attributes such as medium, technique, rendering approach, color treatment, line work, texture, and aesthetic tradition. Do **not** describe the subject, objects, scene, or actions. Examples of style descriptors: \"oil painting with impasto brushstrokes\", \"cel-shaded anime\", \"photorealistic digital illustration\", \"watercolor sketch with soft washes\", \"line art in the style of Moebius\", \"cyberpunk vector graphic\", \"gritty film noir photography\", \"Studio Ghibli-inspired hand-drawn animation\". Prioritize accuracy and specificity. Avoid vague terms like \"beautiful\", \"modern\", or \"artistic\". Output only the style description — no labels, explanations, or extra text."
